        "#**Comparing Abortion Rates Between Liberal and Conservative States**#\n",
        "\n",
        "**Introduction:** The topic of Abortion is a hotbed issue with the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court case ruling of Roe v Wade (1973) was a landmark case that forbade states from banning abortion; essentially legalizing the procedure in the United States. Debate and controversy ensued for close to 50 years as conservatives and liberals wrangled over the status of this ruling. Opinions about abortion's legality, morality, and the constitutionality of the ruling abounds across all party lines but a common thread emerged; conservatives tend to support an overturning of Roe v Wade, while liberals tend to focus on enabling the power a woman should have over their own body. The factionalism that ensued is the focal point of our analysis. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Research Question:** Does the political affiliation of a state influence the rate of abortion?\n",
        "\n",
        "The findings can illuminate the psychological and behavioral tendencies of parents when deciding on whether or not they should abort a child. Conservative states would tend to stigmatize the act of abortion, while liberal states would provide support and a \"safe-haven\" mentality for those who have to make the difficult choice of going through with an abortion. This begs the question: will a conservative state actually promote a higher abortion rate than a liberal state? The logic behind this is that conservative states may provide an insufficient safe-sex curriculum; moreover, abortions can be discreet, teen motherhood cannot.   \n",
        "\n",
        "**Data to be Used:** The data that will need to be collected is from the Open Science Framework via a [csv file](#https://osf.io/td7mk). The Open Science Framework is an open source platform for collaboration and research in the vast spectrum of the sciences. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach:** The data will be managed by reading into the .csv file and then prepping, cleaning, and shaping the data. The statistical analysis will focus on the range of abortion rates up to and including teenagers (< 20 years) and adults up to the maximum child-bearing age. The statistical findings will give us vital information because there is a higher prevalence of unplanned pregnancies amongst teens then there are amongst adult women. Another key to our analysis is to bin the conservative and liberal states in a sensible manner. This will be accomplished by labelling a conservative (red) state and a liberal (blue) state by the political affiliation of the sitting governor for a majority of the years we are looking at. We plan to implement a correlation matrix, scatterplot, boxplot, regplot, and histogram, as well as other relevant graphics that may help showcase our findings. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Team Layout:** As a group, we have decided to work on the various components in a singular manner. The data prep, feature engineering, modeling, analysis, and the presentation notes is a collective effort. Specifically, Laura is doing the introduction background, outliers, graph analysis. Tsering is doing feature selection, 2 distinct models and the data analysis. Shweta is doing 2 distinct models, a Python model and the data interpretation. Philip is doing feature analysis, data cleaning, and presentation notes. \n"
